Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

I)
     a) the runtime would be O(n) linear time because as n increases, the while loop would have to run more times in proportion to the size of n.
     b) the runtime would be O(n) because the outer for loop will continue running until n is reached, and the inner for loops depend on the outer one.
     c) the runtime would be O(n) because bunnyEars will be called recursively until bunnies equals 0

II) Since there are only 2 possible outcomes, binary search would probably be the best. If it breaks: cut my floor number in half and test again until I find the right floor. If it doesn't break, I can my floor number and test again until I get the right floor.
